    We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students.
If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

TDS TA

Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.

Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.

The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.
 Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.

As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.

Kind regards

> **Image Description**: The image displays an online exam interface accessible via `exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga3`. The exam, noted as "TDS 2025 Jan GA3", has an end date of Wednesday, February 5, 2025, 11:59 PM IST, and currently shows a score of 0.

Key instructions and rules are visible:
*   **Browser Performance:** Suggests turning off security restrictions or using a different browser if loading issues occur.
*   **Resource Usage:** Permits the use of any resources, including the internet, ChatGPT, friends, and any libraries or frameworks.
*   **Hacking Allowed:** States that obtaining answers by "hacking the code for this quiz" is allowed.
*   **Server Requirement:** Notes that multiple servers must run simultaneously for checking or saving answers.

A section prompts users with "Have questions?" and provides a link to "Join the discussion on Discourse". The user is logged in as `23f3004066@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`, with a "Logout" option available.

Under "Recent saves," three previous saves are listed, all from February 1, 2025, at different times (4:06:41 PM, 4:06:37 PM, 4:06:32 PM), each showing a "Score: 8" and a "Reload" button. The bottom of the visible area shows a partial heading for "Questions", indicating the start of the exam questions.

Dear Bhavanagv,

The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.

Kind regards

There are some errors in grading for GA2 and  GA3 for TDS, even after submitting the assignments score 0 was given and the seek portal displayed assignment was not submitted given that the login was from my own account and was submitted before the time and still got a score of 0.

[![Screenshot 2025-02-07 201316](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/2/9/29b6332cf814991a2cdae74355e67478bcc57c57_2_690x356.png)

> **Image Description**: The image displays an online exam interface with a dark theme.

The top bar indicates the exam "Ended at Wed, 5 Feb, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and shows "Score: 0" along with "Check all" and "Save" buttons.

The main content area presents seven instructions for the exam:
1.  Learn what you need; reading material is provided.
2.  Check answers regularly by pressing "Check"; allows multiple checks.
3.  Save regularly by pressing "Save"; last saved submission is evaluated.
4.  Reloading is OK; answers are saved in the browser, not the server; questions won't change except for randomized parameters.
5.  Browser may struggle; suggests turning off security restrictions or trying a different browser.
6.  Use anything; specifies "The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want."
7.  It's hackable; "possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz."
A "Note" states: "You'll run multiple servers in this exam. All of them must be running simultaneously while checking or saving answers."

Below the instructions, a blue box offers support: "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse."

The interface shows "You are logged in as 23f2000232@ds.study.iitm.ac.in" and a "Logout" button.

A "Recent saves" section is visible, indicating "most recent is your official score." It lists three past saves:
*   Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:29:19 PM. Score: 6
*   Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:29:07 PM. Score: 6
*   Reload from 2/5/2025, 11:00:34 PM. Score: 4.5

I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as
4.25
, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored
7.25
 shown after submission.

Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

Hi Satish,

Your last submitted score is the only valid score. You have to check before submitting that the score is correct. There is a reload button to load previous answers. But some answers require a live service. If the live service is not running at the time of the check (when you hit the submit button), you will not be scored for those questions. Please make sure that you have any live services running when the submit button is used and check that the last saved score is correct.

Kind regards
