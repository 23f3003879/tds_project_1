> **Image Description**: The image displays a laptop screen showing the GitHub Actions interface for the repository `Sakshi6749/my-repo`. The 'Actions' tab is currently selected, displaying workflow runs.

On the left sidebar, "All workflows" is selected, and a specific workflow named "Daily Commit" is listed. Management options such as "Caches", "Attestations", "Runners", "Usage metrics", and "Performance metrics" are also visible.

The main content area presents a "Filter workflow runs" search bar and a summary indicating "3 workflow runs". Below this, a table-like list details three distinct workflow executions, all showing a red 'X' status icon, indicating failure:
1.  **"second time"**: Identified as "Daily Commit #3", triggered by a commit push from "Sakshi6749" on the "main" branch, occurring "33 minutes ago" and completing in "10s".
2.  **"Daily Commit"**: Identified as "Daily Commit #2", manually run by "Sakshi6749" on the "main" branch, occurring "4 hours ago" and completing in "10s".
3.  **"Daily Commit"**: Identified as "Daily Commit #1", manually run by "Sakshi6749" on the "main" branch, occurring "4 hours ago" and completing in "11s".

The Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom of the screen, displaying the current date as "09-02-2025" and time as "23:41".
