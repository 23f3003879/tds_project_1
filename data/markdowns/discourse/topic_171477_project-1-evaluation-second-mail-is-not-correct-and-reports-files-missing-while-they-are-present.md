> **Image Description**: The image shows the pre-requisite checks for Project 1 in the Tools in Data Science course. The project requires a GitHub repository with a LICENSE file (MIT license) and a valid Dockerfile. The Docker image must be publicly accessible and use the same Dockerfile as in the repository. 

The image also presents evaluation results:
- Docker image present and public: PASS
- GitHub repo present and public: FAIL
- Dockerfile present in the root of the repo: FAIL
- MIT license present in the root of the repo: FAIL

Good Morning Sir,

This is my github repo:
[GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1](https://github.com/kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1)
 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)

I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

Apologies for that,

The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.

Kind regards

Hi
[@carlton](/u/carlton)
,

I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)

The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:

[![First Evaluation Email](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/b/ab6e90977d3a9f6e9a01fd75e236dcbef7834623_2_690x330.png)

> **Image Description**: Here's a concise description of the email image, suitable for a Tools in Data Science student:

The image shows an email titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores," detailing the evaluation of a Docker image submission. It includes links to two Google Drive files:

1.  **Evaluation log file:** Contains performance report on individual tasks.
2.  **Docker log file:** Provides technical performance of the container.

The email also mentions attached files:

*   Server start log file (separate logs for arm vs x86)
*   Evaluation script file (separate logs for arm vs x86)
*   Data generation file
*   Docker orchestration file
*   Solution script (zip)

These files contain information regarding server behavior, evaluation scripts, data generation, Docker image orchestration, and a sample solution script. The Docker image ID is given as well.

> **Image Description**: Here's a concise and factual description of the image:

The image is an email detailing the results of prerequisite evaluations for Project 1 in a Tools in Data Science course.

**Key points:**

*   **Project Evaluation:** The email lists prerequisites for Project 1, which include having a publicly accessible GitHub repository with a MIT license and a valid Dockerfile.
*   **Evaluation Results:**
    *   Docker image is present in Dockerhub and is public: PASS
    *   GitHub repo present AND public: FAIL
    *   Dockerfile present in root of github repo: FAIL
    *   MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL
*   **Outcome:** The email states that the project prerequisites are FAIL and the Project 1 Score is 0.

My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:

[GitHub repo](https://github.com/23f2000345/TDS_final)

Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,

Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?

My GitHub repository for Project-1:
[GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds](https://github.com/sudhishssn134/project_1_tds)

Thanking You

Just attaching the mail I recieved.

The email also states that "MISSING" indicates that the file is not available because the evaluation did not run or the docker image was misconfigured and that missing files will result in a score of 0. The docker image id is also listed.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:

tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

    To replicate the test environment:
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv.

#   "requests",
# ]

Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below

[![Screenshot 2025-04-12 115342](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f58734cfd90a7011b3effca56b9023d51b773c0.png)

> **Image Description**: Here's a summary of the image:

The image shows the output of building a Docker image and then running it.

*   **Docker Build Output:** Lines beginning with "=>" show steps in building a Docker image. It includes extracting layers, copying files, and running `pip install` to install Python requirements.  Several `sha256` hashes are displayed. Build times are noted on the right.
*   **Build Details Link:** A `docker-desktop` URL shows a link to view the build details in the Docker Desktop application.
*   **Docker Run Command:** A command to run a Docker container is shown. It passes an environment variable `AIPROXY_TOKEN` and maps port 8000 on the host to port 8000 inside the container. It uses a `sha256` identifier.
*   **Application Startup:** Information messages show that a server process has started, the application is waiting to startup, and finally the application has started. It indicates Uvicorn is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
