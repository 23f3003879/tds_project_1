On 2nd March, I have both Java OPPE and TDS ROE.

My Java OPPE timing is: 9:30 to 11:00 AM

MY TDS ROE timing is: 10:30 to 11:15 AM

A minimum gap of one hour is recommended.

I have written to support.

 Please look into this.

Apologies for the confusion. I realized that the issue was due to different time zones—Java OPPE displayed IST (GMT +5:30), while TDS ROE showed AST (GMT +3). On the same day, I intended to delete my post on Discourse but couldn’t find it, as it was still in draft mode. So, I deleted it. However, I was surprised to see the post today.

I regret any inconvenience caused.
