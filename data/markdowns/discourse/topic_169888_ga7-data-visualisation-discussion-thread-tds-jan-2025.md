Hi
[@carlton](/u/carlton)
,

I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

> **Image Description**: The image shows two sets of data, each representing information related to PPI (Producer Price Index) industry data for pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing. The first dataset pertains to "Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations" and the second to "Calcium channel blockers," both noted as "not seasonally adjusted." Each dataset includes fields such as "Series Title," "Series ID," "Seasonality," "Survey Name," "Measure Data," "Industry," and "Item." The "Series ID" values are different for the two datasets. The data is presented in a tabular format, likely a spreadsheet.

> **Image Description**: The image shows instructions for a data analysis task for a student in the Tools in Data Science course. The scenario involves analyzing the impact of pharmaceutical exports to the US on India's economy for a political party named Buddhi Daya Nyaay (BDN). The task requires using provided CSV files (Industry Product Segment Information and Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)) to create a new Google Sheet workbook named ga.7.1.rollno (where 'rollno' is replaced with the student's IITM roll number). The workbook needs to be shared with editing rights to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in. The instructions also specify that the sheet names should be exactly as given below: "Sheet1" should include columns for Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. A second sheet named "Sheet2" should contain a pivot table with Item as rows, Year and Month as columns in a hierarchical stack, and Value as values.

Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are

![{7059D6FF-DF75-4B21-999A-29D23A297A90}](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fdec02b5239ef02c5198e250c8a2d6eb007b82.png)

> **Image Description**: The image shows text describing the columns included in a data sheet named "Sheet1." The columns are "Series ID," "Item," "Year," "Month," and "Value."

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”

> **Image Description**: The image shows a table with columns "Series ID", "Year", "Period", "Label", and "Value". The first row of data contains "PCU3254-3254-" in the "Series ID" column, "2023" in the "Year" column, "M01" in the "Period" column, "2023 Jan" in the "Label" column, and "562.445" in the "Value" column.

We have to extract all id’s and their respective item from other sheet and add in first sheet with respect to id’s .

Below items don’t have prices.

PCU3254123254127111

Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations

PCU3254123254127114

Calcium channel blockers

PCU325412325412MM

Miscellaneous receipts

PCU325412325412D112OC

Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter

PCU325412325412D113

Antacids

PCU325412325412SS

Secondary products

PCU3254123254127112

ACE inhibitors

Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.

Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

[Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OrkZgDnx7uYjOxFW2XDrA5F0xFre_PCS/view?usp=drive_link)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

> **Image Description**: Here is a description of the image:

The image shows a spreadsheet displaying data on various items, likely pharmaceutical products, with corresponding values for different months of the year 2023.

The spreadsheet contains the columns "Item", "Year", "Month", "Total", and months of the year 2023, from "M01" to "M05". The "Item" column lists different types of medications or pharmaceutical preparations like "ACE inhibitors", "Analgesics", "Antacids", "Antidepressants", and others.
The "Total" column, as well as "M01" to "M05" show the values for these medications for respective months.
Some of the cells under the "Total" column contain values of 0.

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.

Kind regards

The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Hi
[@carlton](/u/carlton)
 sir,

I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

> **Image Description**: The image is a screenshot of a Gmail inbox. The user has searched for "peer review." Two emails from the sender "22t1 se2002" are displayed. The subject lines indicate these emails are related to TDS (Tools in Data Science) GA 7 (Graded Assignment 7) and peer evaluations. Both emails include HTML file attachments, with "23f3003944.html" appearing in both.

Sir,

In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest
and
 yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.

Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
