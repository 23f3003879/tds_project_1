Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.

Try adding CORS to your code it might work.

Kind regards

> **Image Description**: The image displays a development environment for a Python API application, featuring a Visual Studio Code window, a terminal, and a web browser interface.

The Visual Studio Code window shows `main.py`, a FastAPI application:
*   It imports `FastAPI`, `Query`, `CORSMiddleware`, `List`, `Optional`, and `csv`.
*   It initializes a FastAPI app instance (`app = FastAPI()`).
*   CORS middleware is enabled, allowing all origins, credentials, methods, and headers.
*   Student data is loaded from `/Users/mish/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv` into a list named `students`, with each student entry including `studentId` (integer) and `class` (string).
*   An API endpoint `@app.get("/api")` is defined, `async def get_students`, which optionally accepts a `class` query parameter (list of strings).
*   This endpoint filters `students` based on the provided `class` query or returns all students if no class is specified. Debugging print statements for "Requested classes" and "Filtered students" are present.
*   The application is configured to run using Uvicorn on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

The top right terminal window shows the Uvicorn server output:
*   It indicates the server is running with `--reload` on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
*   Log entries show several HTTP requests:
    *   An `OPTIONS` request to `/` with query parameters `class=1A&class=B&class=7N` returning `200 OK`.
    *   A `GET` request to `/` with the same query parameters resulting in `404 Not Found`.
    *   Subsequent `GET` requests to `/api` and `/api?class=1A` both return `200 OK`, with the code's debugging output showing `Requested classes: None` for the `/api` call and `Requested classes: ['1A']` for the `/?class=1A` call (though the `GET /api?class=1A` log itself only shows `class=1A`).

The bottom right window, likely a web browser, displays part of an "API application using Uvicorn" interface, possibly FastAPI's interactive documentation, with a "Verify" button.

Hi Mishkat,

Please use  triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.

eg

if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.

Thanks and kind regards

**Post URL**: https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga2-deployment-tools-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/161120/14

Hi Mishkat,

This error is because you are filtering on
class_
 instead of
class

So if you send a request on
http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S
 you will see response for that
1S
 class only.

kind regards

Hi Guddu,

Inside
index.html
 file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.

This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.

kind regards.

I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.

Hi Telvin,

Try opening
localhost:8080
 in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.

[@Nelson](/u/nelson)
 I would recommend
[Podman](https://podman.io/)
 or
[Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
 rather than
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
.

Docker Desktop is
[not free for organizations over 250 people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/)
 and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.

[@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640)
 in that case

a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or

a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080

Please try one of these:

Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network

GitHub codespaces, as
[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
 suggested

You
could
 try an ngrok alternative like
[localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/)
 but I don’t think that’ll work.

What is the Docker image URL? It should look like:
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/$USER/$REPO/general

If I use Podman, will the answer be correct assuming I have done all steps correctly?

> **Image Description**: The image displays a computer screen with multiple application windows open, relevant to a "Tools in Data Science" course assignment.

On the left, a web browser shows the JSON response from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class_=1S`. The response is a dictionary with a "students" key, containing a list of student objects. Each student object has a "studentId" and "class" field (e.g., `{"studentId": 288, "class": "1S"}`).

In the center-left, a terminal window titled "mish — Python main.py" displays HTTP request logs. These logs show various `GET` and `OPTIONS` requests made to `/api?class=...` endpoints, with different class values (e.g., `1S`, `2A`, `11V`, `6V`, `12J`, `15K`, `3L`, `11I`, `16`, `2H`). Most requests received an `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` response.

On the right, another web browser displays a graded assignment interface. The assignment is due on "Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and currently has a "Score: 5.5 / 10". The instructions state: "If the URL has a query parameter class, it should return only students in those classes." Examples provided are `/api?class=1A` and `/api?class=1A&class=1B`. It also specifies returning students in the same order as they appear in a CSV file and ensuring CORS is enabled. An input field for the "API URL endpoint for FastAPI" is visible, set to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`, with an error icon beside it. Below the input field, an "Error: Response" section displays a list of student objects, each with a "studentId" and "class" (e.g., `{"studentId":1,"class":"10I"}, {"studentId":2,"class":"12M"}, ...` up to "studentId":38).

Hi Mishkat,

The GA url encoded parameter is
class

In your screenshot, you are using
class_

Your code that we examined earlier also accepts
class_
 as the parameter instead of
class
 as required by the GA

The GA will test your deployment by sending it a request with the url encoded parameter
class

Hi Mishkat,

In your code, the word
class
 is a reserved keyword in python. So simply changing
class_
 to
class
 is not going to work. The
only
 thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api
not
 the variable name used inside your function. Hope that helps you narrow down the problem.

Kind regards

Hi Team ,

For GA - 2 , Question 6:

I am done with the code, deployed same on vercel.

And It is working fine gives correct json response as expected in browser.

But When I try to that on portal It gives me “CORS Missing Allow Origin” Error.

[![Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 6.58.43 PM](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/1/0/10d4f47182314c1b6912b0ab281ce0665238876a_2_690x259.png)

> **Image Description**: The image displays a programming problem and a debugging interface. The problem statement instructs a user to download a `gverce-python.json` file, create and deploy a Python API on Vercel to return marks for specified names (X and Y) in a JSON format like `{"marks": 10, 20}`. An input field for the Vercel URL shows a partially obscured address, `https://shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api`, accompanied by a `TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.`

Below this, a section of browser developer tools is visible, with the Network tab selected. A list of network requests includes a `GET` request to `https://shagra-barodekars-projects.vercel.app/api?name=QICH&name=BUD6`. This request shows a `200 OK` status code but is flagged with a "CORS Missing Allow Origin" warning. The "Headers" sub-tab for this selected request confirms the `200 OK` status and `HTTP/2` version. Another assignment component, "Create a GitHub Action (1.5 marks)," is also partially visible.

I have added “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” as “*” for allowing request from any origin.

I get the correct response in browser but it fails in quiz portal.

Can anyone please suggest what exactly I am missing here.

Thanks

Hi Aindree,

I tried to send a request to your application
https://your-app2.vercel.app/api
 with url encoded parameter
class=7Q
. It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends
{"marks": []}
.

Check if your csv file is correct.  Also check if code is correct.

Kind regards

For the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue

Hi Tushar,

For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running.

For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

Kind regards

For the Q.2 on image compression, for PNG, SVG or WEBP files, I’m getting the error “Could not process image. Is it browser supported image? Image pixels do not match the original” (I believe the last part is not applicable as the image was not processed ). Visually, I could not find any difference between the two files and the size of new file is less than 1,500 bytes.

Tried through Chrome v132.0.6834.83 without any add-ons/extensions.

what to do?

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Load the data

[@23f2003751](/u/23f2003751)

While I understand why you might choose to use
flask
 due to your familiarity with it,

the
http.server
 library is just very simple to use.

The
only extra line of code
 you would need inside your
get
 request if you used the
http.server
 library would be:

self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")

Try to rewrite your code using
http.server
  library so that your debugging for simple tasks like this is easy.

The boilerplate code for a
get
 request using the
http.server
 library was already given in Q6. So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.

Kind regards

[@23F300327](/u/23f300327)
 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.

GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.

Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.

Also the live sessions on
[youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_h5u1jMeBCl1BquBhgunA4t08XAxsA-C&si=NE4LEQe48XfzAYbc)
 will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.

There will be session
2025-01-20T14:30:00Z
→
2025-01-20T16:30:00Z
 which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

The session is in your course calendar and the meet link is

[@23F300327](/u/23f300327)

Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.

When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api

with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.

The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.

That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this

# api/index.py
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')
        self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({"message": "Hello!"}).encode('utf-8'))
        return

Notice there is no
if __name__ == "__main__":
 code block.

This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.

if __name__ == "__main__":
 is used to execute some code
only
 if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.

Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default
handler
 class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.

Another possible problem:

By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues
[TDS > Development Tools > unicode](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/unicode)

So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.

Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.

Kind regards

Hi Mishkat,

I think url that you are submitting is wrong one. In below image there are two url’s under Domains those would be correct url’s to be submitted.

For example
https://tds21jan.vercel.app/
.

I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a
vercel.json
 configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code.

You can follow
[Gui Bibeau’s guide](https://www.frontend-devops.com/blog/python-on-vercel)
 to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM.

For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to
[this guide on DEV Community](https://dev.to/andrewbaisden/how-to-deploy-a-python-flask-app-to-vercel-2o5k)
. I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.

From image that you have shared, it explains ngrok tunnel that you are submitting in answer is not running.

For any assignment if it involves running some server then you would need to keep all the server’s running when you submit

Hi Naman,

error code 524 is generally because of timeout in response, one thing you can check is if there is load on Llama server as information that I got by a google search

 Is there any problem from our end, such as tds hosting server receiving lots of traffic on website.

Hi Irina,

This issue is because localhost is not there is no server available to listen on localhost.You are running ngrok in codespace but Llama server in local machine. run both of them in same machine either codespace or local machine.

Here is reference of error

Regarding question no. 9 Web Framework: FastAPI. I got the following error for the answer to the question

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/f/c/fcd7353786e475229734f8def393d1cda2048b0b.png)

> **Image Description**: The image displays an exercise related to building and testing a FastAPI endpoint. Instructions indicate that the API should handle a `class` query parameter (e.g., `/api?class=1A` or `/api?class=1A&class=1B`) to return students belonging to specified classes, preserving the order from a CSV file. Enabling CORS for GET requests is also required. A suggested API URL endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`. Below this, an error message states "Response undefined does not match expected" followed by a long JSON array of student data. Each student object in the expected response contains `studentid` and `class` keys (e.g., `{"studentid":67,"class":"6X"}`). The final visible instruction indicates that the next step involves sending a request to the URL with the `?class=` query parameter and validating the response against the expected data.

The main content area shows a JSON array of objects, where each object represents a student record containing a `studentId` and a `class` field. For example, `{"studentId":67,"class":"6X"}` and `{"studentId":1994,"class":"78"}` are visible entries. A "Pretty-print" option is also visible on the page.

  Hello Sir, I’m also using Squoosh. The pixel size of the resulting image is 800 x 600 and the file size is 1,473 bytes. The steps I used to create the solution image:

Open Squoosh and load the image

In the dropdown in “Compress” section, select “OxiPNG”. Left the other options unchanged (Interlace checkbox is unchecked, Effort is at 2).

The resulting image is downloaded which has same pixel size as original image but file size is 1,473 bytes

> **Image Description**: The image displays a user interface for image processing, specifically focusing on editing and compression functionalities. Under the "Edit" section, options for "Resize" and "Reduce palette" are present, both appearing inactive with their respective toggle switches in the off position. The "Compress" section features a dropdown menu labeled "OxiPNG," an unchecked "Interlace" checkbox, and an "Effort" slider currently set to a value of '2'. At the bottom, a visual indicator shows a 63% reduction, resulting in a file size of 1.41 kB, accompanied by a download button. Several navigation and settings icons are visible in the top right corner.

I also tried WebP with “Lossless” option selected and “Effort” increased to 9. This gives even smaller filesize at just 630 bytes. However, even that image is not accepted. The selected options for WebP are in the screenshot below.

[@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)

Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”.

Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!

So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.

In the meanwhile:

There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

Once i close my local llm and close the nrgrok URL (after entering the answer and the answer being correct), the next time I refresh or check the answer in the Ga2 site, q10 gets marked wrong. I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again.

because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong.

Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit.

The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks.

Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.”

Kind regards

hi
[@23f2003853](/u/23f2003853)

I think you are running your application server inside a virtual machine because of which it doesn’t have visibility to outside world(request coming from other domains). So you would need to identify  ipaddress of your virtual machine and would need to use that in place of
127.0.0.1
. Take help from GPT to identify ipaddress of virtual machine.

Hello Sir,

I’ve been working on question 6 and I’m facing this error where the marks are not ordered properly. I believe my code appends the marks based on the names that are inputted in the backend but I’m unable to identify the source of this issue. Please shed some light on the same.

> **Image Description**: The image displays a user interface with an instruction, a question, a user input field, and an error message. The instruction states, "Make sure you enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin." Below this, a question asks, "What is the Vercel URL? It should look like: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api`". A text input box, highlighted with a red border indicating an error, contains the URL `https://new1-ivory.vercel.app/api`. Underneath the input box, an error message reads, "Error: Expected [73,73,53,63,61] but got [73,53,61,63,73]".

Hi Shalini,

I deployed my code with your dataset and checked and checked answers for your dataset, so there is no errors in backend.

Since you are getting some output, it won’t help to look up to logs from vercel,  just check your code if it’s logically correct.

Kind regards

Jivraj

> **Image Description**: The image displays Python code for a web server handler class named `handler`, inheriting from `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`.

The `do_GET` method is defined to handle HTTP GET requests. It sets CORS headers, loads JSON data from a file named `../q-vercel-python.json`, parses URL query parameters to extract values for 'name', and returns an error if 'name' is not provided. If names are provided, it iterates through the loaded data to collect 'marks' associated with those names. Finally, it sends a JSON response containing the collected marks or an error message if no names were found.

The `do_OPTIONS` method is defined to handle HTTP OPTIONS requests. It sets CORS headers for preflight requests.

I think in Q.6 its some error in your code’s logic its unable to fetch the data from your code(Even I tried your URL and its just a black page). Make sure your link is working correctly(giving json response) by pasting it to the browser.

I think your code logic seem to be correct but it may be because u have downloaded twice the same image and in your output lenna.webp is saving to lenna(1).webp.

Try to do it again after deleting those images which are already downloaded!

> **Image Description**: The image displays a Python interactive notebook environment, likely Google Colab, showing code and its execution output.

The visible Python code block performs the following actions:
1.  Imports `numpy` for numerical operations, `PIL.Image` for image handling, `google.colab.files` for file uploads, and `colorsys` for color system conversions.
2.  Initiates a file upload process using `files.upload()`.
3.  Opens the first uploaded image using `Image.open()`.
4.  Converts the image to a NumPy array and normalizes pixel values to a 0-1 range.
5.  Calculates the lightness component (HLS model, second element of HLS tuple) for each pixel's RGB value using `colorsys.rgb_to_hls` and `np.apply_along_axis`.
6.  Counts the number of pixels where the calculated lightness exceeds a threshold of 0.219.
7.  Prints the final count of these "light" pixels as an f-string.

Below the code block, the execution output is visible:
1.  A "Choose Files" button is present, followed by "lenna.webp".
2.  Confirmation of the file upload for "lenna.webp" is displayed, showing its size (14820 bytes), last modified date (1/30/2025), and 100% completion status.
3.  The final output from the `print` statement is shown: "Number of pixels with lightness > 0.219: 248985".

This must be a production deployment url, that’s why I am not able to access it.

The issue might be with the IP address you’re using. Try using
127.0.0.1
 and check if it’s the correct localhost IP for your machine. Also, test with
http://localhost:8000/api
 to see if it works.

If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the
ipconfig
 command to check the correct IP address.

We usually address doubts at the end of every session. Our next session is on the 31st—you can join then and ask your question if none of above solutions works.

The active file, `fast.py`, includes a line `data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")`, indicating the use of the pandas library to load data from a CSV file. Below this, a FastAPI endpoint (`@app.get("/api")`) is defined. This endpoint's asynchronous function (`async def root(...)`) uses `data.query("city == @city")` to filter the loaded data, extract a "population" value, and return it along with the city as a JSON object. The VS Code status bar indicates the current line (16), column (31), Python 3.11.4 within a virtual environment, and extensions like Go Live, Codeium, and Prettier. The overall view is framed within a video conferencing application, showing controls, a participant bubble for "Saransh," and the text "Saransh is presenting."

Hi Srividya,

Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.

When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.

This renders
name == main
 part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).

In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You
do not
 create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.

This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.

Thanks for your input.

Kind regards

Questions 9 and 10 require running a development server from my side. Right now, the questions are marked correct and I’ve saved the assignment. Since the servers won’t always be running, I hope this won’t cause a problem during evaluation.

Both the left and right panes show an array of JSON objects, each containing `"class"` and `"studentId"` key-value pairs. Examples of `class` values include "2W", "4X", "4Z", and "5W", while `studentId` values are integers such as 44, 86, 179, and 411. Line numbers are visible for both data displays.

> **Image Description**: The image displays a web browser interface for a "Tools in Data Science" assignment, showing a score of 7.5/10.

The top section outlines an API development task:
*   An API endpoint at `/api` should accept `class` query parameters (e.g., `?class=1A&class=1B`) to filter students, returning only those in the specified classes and maintaining the order from a CSV file.
*   CORS must be enabled for GET requests.
*   The configured API URL endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
*   An error message indicates "Response undefined does not match expected" JSON data, followed by a large example of the expected JSON structure: an array of objects, each containing `studentId` and `class` fields (e.g., `{"studentId":60,"class":"IN"}`).
*   The system will test by sending requests with `?class=` parameters and checking the response.

The bottom section shows Chrome Developer Tools with the "Network" tab selected.
*   The filter is set to "Fetch/XHR".
*   A network request for `/api?class=IN&class=8N&class=8X&class=4Z` is visible.
*   The "Response" tab for this request is open, displaying the actual JSON response received from the API. This response is an array of objects, similar to the expected format, showing `studentId` and `class` values for multiple students (e.g., `[{"studentId":60,"class":"IN"}, {"studentId":64,"class":"IN"}, {"studentId":106,"class":"IN"}, ...]`).
*   The network tab also indicates "2 requests", "1.0 KB transferred", and "820 B resources".

@ carlton @ Jivraj

Gentlemen! In GA2 answers, I have a problem.

Question 10, the ngrok tunnel url was once correct and I saved it . When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.

Do I need to do anything else ?

Secondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.

Third, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 …it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.

In the ngrok question I was getting that same json error as everybody else since last 7 days or so. The ngrok link was working fine in browser every time but. Today i ran the LLama file with
--n-gpu-layers 35
 parameter at the end which makes it run using my laptops graphics card i guess. After i ran LLama file using this and ngrok later, my link was accepted in the GA 2 and i did not get any error after that.

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
 did this happen because i ran LLama file using my laptop GPU? This was suggested to me by another student who had the same problem.

Try these
[@21f3000745](/u/21f3000745)

Download the data file once again and replace it with your current file, then deploy.

If this doesn’t work, then:

Try clicking on Check button once again. There are few cases where due to duplicity or other problems in the data, this bug occurs. The next check will most probably work.

Reload the page, open the Networks Tab in the Inspect menu, click on Fetch/XHR filter button. Next click on check, if this error prompts up, you will get the request the system sent to check your answer. Copy that request and check on localhost.

The terminal output shows a Uvicorn server running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with reloader process `[18904]` using `StatReload`. The server is configured to watch for changes in the directory `F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\Week 2\Fastapi`.

After application startup completion, several HTTP requests are logged:
*   Two "GET" requests to the root path (`/`) and `favicon.ico` resulted in "404 Not Found" errors.
*   Four "GET" requests to `/api?class=1A` from different local ports (53984, 54003, 54004, 54145) successfully returned "200 OK" responses.

Hi
[@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)
 ,

As error mentions to add tag to image.

Adding different tags is like versioning your docker image, image with a particular tag can be pulled.

For adding tag use

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/b/7b580a40e755d3aab9c3b40941904405e516abf4_2_690x295.png)

> **Image Description**: The image displays a set of instructions and commands for container management using `podman`. The title indicates the commands are for building, running, and deploying a container.

The instructions are categorized into four sections, each preceded by a comment:
1.  **Login:** Guides the user to create an account on `https://hub.docker.com/` and then provides the command `podman login docker.io` to log in.
2.  **Build and Run:** Provides commands to build and run the container: `podman build -t py-hello .` and `podman run -it py-hello`.
3.  **Push to Docker Hub (latest tag):** Instructs the user to replace `$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` with their Docker Hub username and provides the command `podman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello`.
4.  **Push with specific tag:** Shows how to push the container with a specific tag (e.g., `dev`) using the command `TAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG`.

For GA2 there is not question that asks if you visited GA2 page or not.

Just answer on GA2 page

Hi
[@24f1002359](/u/24f1002359)

For
Question 10
, ensure that
all servers are running
 every time you submit (click the
Save
 button). Since
ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs
, double-check that the
ngrok URL is correct
 before submitting.

For
Question 9
, did you
enable CORS
? To verify, check your
browser console
—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.

> **Image Description**: The image displays the Chrome Developer Tools, specifically the "Console" tab, which is currently active. Other visible tabs include "Elements," "Sources," "Network," "Performance," "Memory," and "Application."

The console output shows three entries:
1.  An informational message: "starting ajax request to the resource." linked to `index.html:14`.
2.  Another informational message: "ajax request done." linked to `index.html:29`.
3.  A red error message: "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://google.com/' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource." This error is linked to `index.html:1`.

A red icon with the number "1" indicates one error has occurred in the console. The console also features a "Filter" input field and "Default levels" dropdown, along with settings and clear buttons.

The upper portion of the content area features an embedded screen showing a code editor displaying a file named `INSTALLATION.md`. Visible code includes markdown headings like `INSTALLATION` and bullet points detailing installation steps for technologies such as `node.js`, `Python`, `rust`, `Go`, and `Deno`.

The lower portion presents a question requiring the publication of a page using GitHub Pages. The student must ensure the email address `24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` is present in the page's HTML, wrapped with `<!--email_off-->` and `<!--/email_off-->` tags to accommodate CloudFlare's email obfuscation.

Below the question, there's a prompt asking for the GitHub Pages URL, with an example format `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`. An input field contains the text `https://ullagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/?v=1,?v=2`.

An error message, displayed in a red box, states: "Error: 24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response". This is followed by a snippet of HTML code from the URL, showing a basic HTML structure with a `title` of "My Model Page", an `h1` of "My Model Page", and a paragraph including an obfuscated email link (CloudFlare's `cdn-cgi/email-protection` script).

A hint suggests adding `?v=1, ?v=2` to the URL to bust the cache if recent changes are not reflected. A "Check" button is present at the bottom.

Hi
[@24DS1000121_ULAGAOOZ](/u/24ds1000121_ulagaooz)
 ,

That’s because GitHub protects your email when an external website requests a GitHub Page. To disable this protection, create a
.nojekyll
 file in your root folder of your repository.

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/4/64798b0686fda7cc36e604c3040f40e2872474b5_2_690x293.png)

> **Image Description**: The image displays a two-panel interface.

The left panel presents a question: "What is the GitHub Pages URL?" with an example format `https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/`. An input field contains the URL `https://ulagaoozhian.github.io/TDS-page/`. Below the input, an error message is visible: "Error: 24ds1000121@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is not in the response:". This error message is followed by a snippet of HTML code, which includes `<DOCTYPE html>`, `<title>My Model Page</title>`, `<h1>My Model Page</h1>`, and a paragraph `<p>Contact me at: <a href="cdn-cgi/email-protection...">[email protected]</a></p>`. At the bottom, a suggestion is provided: "If a recent change that's not reflected, add ?v=1, ?v=2 to the URL to bust the cache."

The right panel shows a web browser's developer tools, specifically the Network tab. Under the "Name" column, a request for "TDS-page/" is listed. The "Preview" sub-tab is selected, displaying the rendered content of the HTML response: "My Model Page" as a large heading and "Contact me at: [email protected]" as a smaller text below it. The console shows "1 requests", "0 B transferred", and "61 ms".

I am facing this issue. It is stating the error as mentioned

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/a/6/a65a73e26776aa7f03943523ae128705930fa05e_2_690x243.png)

> **Image Description**: The image displays instructions and an error message related to building a FastAPI application.

**Instructions/Requirements:**
*   **Query Parameter Handling:** If the URL has a `class` query parameter, the API should return only students belonging to those classes.
    *   Example: `/api?class=1A` returns students in class 1A.
    *   Example: `/api?class=1A&class=1B` returns students in classes 1A and 1B.
    *   Any number of classes can be specified.
    *   Students should be returned in the same order as they appear in the CSV file, not by the order of classes in the query.
*   **CORS:** Enable CORS to allow GET requests from any origin.
*   **API Endpoint:** The suggested FastAPI endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.

**Visible Content:**
*   The API endpoint input field shows `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`.
*   **Error Message:** An "Error: Response" is displayed, indicating a mismatch between the received API response and an expected output.
    *   **Received Response (partial):** A JSON array of student objects, e.g., `[{"studentId":113,"class":"5W"},{"studentId":206,"class":"8H"}, ...]`
    *   **Expected Response (partial):** Another JSON array of student objects, e.g., `[{"studentId":202,"class":"4Z"},{"studentId":592,"class":"4Z"}, ...]`
    *   The error explicitly states "does not match expected".
*   **Final Hint:** "We'll check by sending a request to this URL with ?class-... added and check if the response matches the data."

The JSON data is presented in a raw, unformatted string, lacking indentation or line breaks for readability. The browser interface includes an address bar, multiple tabs, and a bookmarks bar with various links.

The problem is that, if class param is passed, only then it is filtering as usual, but when no param is passed it returns the entire DataFrame, which is not supposed to happen.

If no parameter is passed it should return an empty list.

I suspect you directly copied this code from ChatGPT without understanding, which is acceptable for us, but not very helpful for you.

Even there is no submission button provided in GA2 and GA3 on the portal unlike Graded Assignment 1.

We have removed that button, cause it was causing confusion among the students.

If you have saved your answers on the TDS portal then you need not worry, you will be marked. The button was just there to ensure you saw the assignment on the TDS portal.

TDS TA

Yes. The scores you achieve in the TDS portal are your scores for the GA. It’s not necessary to do anything on the Seek Portal.

Actually even on the portal it’s showing like this:

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/3/8/38f632fba8ac8ada694ecf27891ee06ffdedb25a_2_690x388.png)

> **Image Description**: The image displays an online assessment interface for a course, likely "Tools in Data Science" (TDS), as indicated by the active browser tab. The assessment is labeled "TDS 2025 Jan GA1."

A red banner at the top states "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST" and shows "Score: 0". Partially visible text below the banner reads: "7. It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed."

Further down, text provides guidance related to the TDS course:
*   "If this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK in TDS."
*   "If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with effort and luck."

A blue box contains the text "Have questions? Join the discussion on Discourse." The user is logged in as "22F2001630@ds.study.iitm.ac.in".

A "Recent saves" section is visible, listing three entries, each stating: "Reload from 1/25/2025, 10:56:53 PM. Score: 6.5". The beginning of a "Questions" section is visible at the bottom of the content area.

So it’s confusing.

Just Checked my Score Card.

> **Image Description**: The image displays a student dashboard for the IIT Madras Degree in Data Science and Applications on February 3, 2025, for the January 2025 term. The dashboard lists "My Current Courses." Visible courses include "Tools in Data Science," marked as a "NEW COURSE" with "Week 1 Assignment - 65.00" displayed, and "Business Data Management - Project," labeled as a "RETRY PROJECT" with "Registered" status. Both courses have corresponding "Go to Course page" or "Go to Project page" buttons. The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) for the term is 8.3, and the Project Cumulative Grade Point Average (Project CGPA) for the term is 0.0. A harassment reporting statement with an email contact (`students-grievance@study.iitm.ac.in`) is present at the bottom.

Thank you for your attention to our problems you are the real heroes.
