> **Image Description**: The image displays a dark-themed web interface, likely for an online assessment or course platform.

At the top, a user is logged in, identified by the email address "23f1002630@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," with a "Logout" button below it.

Below the login information, a section titled "Recent saves" (with a note "(most recent is your official score)") indicates "No recent saves."

A central section shows a loading animation and the text "Loading questions...", indicating an attempt to retrieve content.

Finally, a red error box is prominently displayed with the heading "Error!". The primary message states: "Sorry, we couldn't load the questions. That's strange." A more technical error message follows: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')". The section concludes with the instruction: "Please contact the exam team for assistance."

 - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.

What happened?
 I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”

Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

> **Image Description**: The image outlines a data science task focused on "Peak Usage Analysis for Regional Content" from a GZipped Apache web log file.

The problem statement describes the need to analyze `s-anand.net` access logs from May 2024, containing 258,074 rows, to understand user behavior, particularly for the `/telugu/` content section. The data is recorded in the GMT-0500 timezone.

Log file characteristics are detailed: fields are space-separated, generally double-quoted, with a specific note that the 'Time' field is not quoted and 41 rows have unique quoting issues.

Each log entry's fields are defined:
*   **IP:** Visitor's IP address.
*   **Remote logname/user:** Typically "-".
*   **Time:** Timestamp, e.g., `[01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]`.
*   **Request:** Contains HTTP Method (e.g., GET), URL (e.g., `/telugu/`), and Protocol (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
*   **Status:** HTTP status code (200-299 defined as successful).
*   **Size:** Response size in bytes.
*   **Referer:** Referer URL.
*   **User agent:** Browser information.
*   **Vhost:** Virtual host (`s-anand.net`).
*   **Server:** Server IP address.

The primary task for a data analyst is to determine the count of successful GET requests for `/telugu/` pages made on Saturdays between 13:00 and 23:00 during May 2024. This metric is stated to aid in "Scale Resources," "Content Planning," and "Marketing Insights." A final question at the bottom, however, asks for the same analysis specifically for "Sundays" instead of "Saturdays".

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-

Thank you

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.

Please consider my request and double check-

> **Image Description**: The image displays a case study document titled "Case Study: Recovering Sales Data for ReceiptRevive Analytics." It describes a data recovery problem involving incomplete JSON sales data obtained through OCR, specifically noting missing 'id' fields and truncated entries. The expected sales entry fields are listed as 'city', 'product', 'sales', and 'id'.

The "Your Task" section outlines three programming steps:
1.  **Parse the Sales Data:** Read a provided 100-row JSON file and accurately extract 'sales' figures despite truncated data and missing 'id's.
2.  **Data Validation and Cleanup:** Handle incomplete fields, focusing solely on 'sales' values due to the missing 'id'.
3.  **Calculate Total Sales:** Sum all 'sales' values to provide a single aggregate figure.

The document also lists strategic benefits of successful data recovery, such as reconstructing historical data and informing business decisions. A download link for the data file, "e-parse-partial-json.jsonl", is present at the bottom. The terms "sales" and "id" are visually highlighted in the text.

I am facing an issue with GA5 Q5, as my answer is being marked incorrect despite multiple attempts. I have processed data at OpenRefine .

To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect.

Sir Could you please check portal expected answer for this question.

[@Saransh_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.

Now we are struggling with Q8.

MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called
post_id
 , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.

when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error :
Error
: At root: Array length mismatch

Reason
:  below query checking only 1st comment (
$[0]
 refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.

But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.

WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.

May be my query is wrong or may be not.

Thankyou

[@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)

Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.

Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.

In this case its an ordered
post_id

So thats where you begin:

SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.

Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.

You will still need the
post_id
 for the
outermost layer
 so you have to continue extracting it from the
inner layers
 of the nested query.

...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...

Then the final layer of the nest

...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
...

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)

But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.

Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.

Kind regards

[@daksh76](/u/daksh76)
 thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.

If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?

Thats why you are getting the error.

Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.

Kind regards

Thank you for your response
[@carlton](/u/carlton)
. You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:

json_extract
:
“Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”

json_each
:
“Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”

json_extract_path_text
:
“Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.

I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for
Q8
.

Thankyou

> **Image Description**: The image displays a problem statement and task for a data cleaning and analysis exercise. The main title is "Improving Sales Data Accuracy for RetailWise Inc." The initial text describes issues with an Excel file containing 1,000 transaction records, specifically listing six problematic columns: Customer Name, Country, Date, Product, Sales and Cost, and TransactionID, along with their respective data quality issues.

"Your Task" is outlined, requiring the calculation of total margin based on specific criteria: sales up to a certain date (Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 India Standard Time), for product "Theta," and country "US." The formula for Total Margin is provided as (Total Sales - Total Cost) / Total Sales.

Six challenges for the solution are listed:
1.  Trim and Normalize Strings (Customer Name, Country).
2.  Standardize Date Formats (MM-DD-YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD to ISO 8601).
3.  Extract the Product Name (e.g., "Theta" from "Theta/5x01vd").
4.  Clean and Convert Sales and Cost (remove "USD" text, handle missing Cost as 50% of Sales).
5.  Filter the Data (by date, product, and country criteria).
6.  Calculate the Margin.

A section on "By cleaning the data and calculating accurate margins, RetailWise Inc. can:" lists benefits like improved decision making, enhanced reporting, and streamlined operations. A download link for "q-clean-up-excel-sales-data.xlsx" is visible.

The image concludes with a question prompt: "What is the total margin for transactions before Tue Jun 14 2022 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) for Theta sold in US (which may be spelt in different ways)?" Below the question, an input field shows "0.0" with an "Error: Incorrect answer" message. A note specifies the accepted answer format (percentage or decimal).

In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before
Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)
 for
Theta
 sold in
the US
 (which may be spelled in different ways).

However, when I filter in Excel for
US
 and
Theta
, there are no entries for
Sales
 and
Cost
. But
0
 as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect.

(I cross-checked this using GPT.)

**Post URL**: https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-data-preparation-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/166576/71

For Q8, I wrote the following query,

SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;

What it does is for each post_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post_id. Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order.

But it’s giving me an
Array length mismatch
 error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful.

P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

Contextual information about the data format is provided:
- **Request:** Composed of Method (e.g., GET), URL (e.g., /blog/), and Protocol (e.g., HTTP/1.1).
- **Status:** HTTP status code, with successful requests defined as 200 <= Status < 300.
- **Size:** Response size in bytes.

after trying python codes chatgpt i tried using linux commands

bash-5.2$ zgrep ‘GET /malayalammp3/’ s-anand.net-May-2024.gz

| grep -E ‘[(04|11|18|25)/May/2024:(10|11|12|13|14|15|16):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]’

| grep -E ’ “(GET|POST) .* HTTP/1.[01]” (2[0-9][0-9]) ’ | wc -l

2316

i’m getting 2316 but when i enter in the answer box it says incorrect

QUESTION 9

I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.

Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.

In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”

The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.

Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.

From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.

Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation "

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I had exams and would like do week 4,week 5 before week 6 and doing the assignment is a huge part in learning, any on the just doing the assignments or answers for the assignments? I understand that each set of students get different questions.
