Hello,

I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Kind regards

Dear Sir,

I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

Hello,

I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9,  so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

Respected Sir,

I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal

According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?

Thanks

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Respected Sir/Madam,

I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox

I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment

and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this

It emphasizes using the correct student ID for evaluation. The first question asks if the student has seen and attempted the assignment, with "Yes" being the correct answer. The displayed response "No" results in an incorrect score of 0. The accepted answer is "Yes".

Dear
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)
 sir,

For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.

I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission

 I had made my submission for GA1 on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved, can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.

Below this activity log, a user's message states: "I have attempted the assignment and also saved my score, but i forgot to just click yes on the other portal, can you please allow thi ssubmission to be evaluated ?"

The lower section presents a question from Graded Assignment 1, preceded by a critical instruction: "You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment, otherwise your score will not be considered for evaluation." Question 1 asks: "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." The displayed submission shows "No" selected, which is marked as "No, the answer is incorrect," resulting in a "Score: 0." The "Accepted Answers" for this question is listed as "Yes."

Hi Mandy,

Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).
