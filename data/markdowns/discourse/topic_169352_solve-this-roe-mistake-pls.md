> **Image Description**: Here's a concise description of the image for a Tools in Data Science student:

The image shows an online quiz interface titled "TDS 2025 Jan ROE." It displays instructions emphasizing the use of available resources, including the internet and ChatGPT, and even mentions the quiz is "hackable."  It highlights the importance of saving and checking answers regularly.  There is also a link to a form for bonus marks, specifically for IITM students. Finally, a "Recent Saves" section shows past submissions with timestamps and scores.

Did you submit before 1:47? If yes, then your highest score will be taken.

If not then, you will be marked absent.
