Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited

Now I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to
[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)
 and the entire course team who designed this amazing course

I hope ChatGPT solves deployment next

> **Image Description**: The image displays a development environment featuring a Python code editor, a console output, and a chatbot interface.

The Python code in the 'Wiki Outline Api' section is designed to fetch content from a Wikipedia page for a specified country, parse its HTML using Beautiful Soup, and extract headings (H1 to H6). It uses the `requests` library for HTTP requests and includes error handling for failed fetches, returning a JSON response with a 404 status.

The console displays module import paths from `starlette.datastructures`, `starlette.concurrency`, `anyio`, and `ssl`, concluding with a 'Run successfully' message.

The adjacent chatbot communication indicates a prior `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ssl'` issue. The chatbot states it 'updated the code to handle environments without SSL by including a workaround for SSL configuration using `certifi` and checking the `PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY` environment variable' to resolve this error.
