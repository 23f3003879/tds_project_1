> **Image Description**: The image displays an online assessment interface titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation."

The top bar indicates the assessment "Ended at Fri, 21 Feb, 2025, 11:59 PM IST" and shows a current "Score: 0." Buttons for "Check," "Check all," and "Save" are visible.

A list of seven instructions is provided:
1.  Learn what you need from reading material.
2.  Check answers regularly by pressing "Check" button to see right/wrong answers.
3.  Save regularly by pressing "Save" button multiple times; the last saved submission will be evaluated.
4.  Reloading is stated as "OK," with answers saved in the browser and questions unchanging except for randomized parameters.
5.  Browser may struggle, advising to turn off security restrictions or try a different browser.
6.  Permits the use of "anything" including the internet, ChatGPT, friends, libraries, or frameworks.
7.  States "It's hackable" and allows obtaining answers by hacking the code.

Below the instructions, a section titled "Have questions?" includes a link to "Join the discussion on Discourse."

Further down, the user is identified as "23f3004238@ds.study.iitm.ac.in," with a "Logout" button.

A "Recent saves" section lists previous submission attempts with timestamps and scores, indicating the most recent save is the official score. Visible saves include:
*   21/02/2025, 23:18:35, Score: 9 (marked as most recent)
*   21/02/2025, 23:15:07, Score: 9
*   21/02/2025, 23:03:00, Score: 8
Each listed save has a "Reload" option.

Is this something to worry about?

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that.

Kind regards
