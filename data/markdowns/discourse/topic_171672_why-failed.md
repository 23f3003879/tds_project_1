> **Image Description**: The image shows the prerequisite evaluation results for a "Project 1" assignment. The requirements include:

1.  GitHub repository existence and public accessibility.
2.  A LICENSE file with the MIT license in the repository.
3.  A valid Dockerfile in the repository.
4.  Docker image accessibility and running via podman.
5.  The Docker image using the same Dockerfile as in the repository.

The evaluation results show that the Docker image is present and public, the GitHub repository is present and public, and the Dockerfile is present in the root of the GitHub repository. However, the MIT license is missing from the root of the GitHub repository.

The final assessment shows that the prerequisites are not met (FAIL) and the Project 1 score is 0.

> **Image Description**: Here's a description of the image for a student in a Tools in Data Science course:

**Content:** The image is a screenshot of a GitHub Docs page showing instructions on how to add a license to a repository.

**Key elements:**

*   **GitHub Interface:** It shows sections of the GitHub user interface where a user can add a new file to a repository. A file name field where the user should type "LICENSE" or "LICENSE.md".
*   **Instructions:**  Numbered steps (3 through 6) guide the user through the process. The visible instructions refer to typing the license file name, choosing a license template, selecting a license, and reviewing/submitting the changes.
*   **Buttons and Links:** A button labeled "Choose a license template" is highlighted.
*   **Documentation:** The URL indicates that this is a part of GitHub's documentation on community contributions.

I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as
Licenese.md
 but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).

So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

> **Image Description**: Here's a concise and factual description of the image for a student in a Tools in Data Science course:

The image displays a commit history, likely from a Git repository, specifically showing a timeline of changes made to files. We can see the commit messages, such as "Rename License.md to LICENSE.md", "Update License.md", and "Update and rename README.md to License.md". Each commit shows the author (virajpitale) and the date of the commit. Next to each commit are the author, commit date, and the corresponding hexadecimal commit IDs ("d62d2ee", "762400b", "26f75aa", "c94aac6"). All the commits, except the final commit, are labeled "Verified".

I submitted the project
within the deadline
, and I ensured that
all requirements were fulfilled
, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.

However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.

Here is my GitHub repo for your reference:
[GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1](https://github.com/virajpitale/tds-project1)

I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.

Thank you for your understanding.
