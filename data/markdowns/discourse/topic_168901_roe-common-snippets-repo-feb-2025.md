> **Image Description**: The image displays a graphical representation of a version control system's commit history. The main panel shows a branching diagram with colored lines and circular nodes, representing distinct commits or merge points. Each node is associated with a textual description of the commit message, such as "Merge pull request #2," "Added chardet code to get file encoding," "Rename README.txt.txt to README_LLM.tx," and "Added an extractions notebook." The "main" branch is visible next to the topmost commit entry, accompanied by an eye icon and a cloud icon. Above the commit history, a header indicates "SOURCE CONTROL GR..." (likely "SOURCE CONTROL GRAPH" or "SOURCE CONTROL GIT"), with options like "Auto" and various icons for operations such as branching, filtering, and syncing.

Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.
