> **Image Description**: The image displays question 16 of a technical task, titled "Move and rename files (0.5 marks)". The task instructs the user to:
1.  Download and extract `q-move-rename-files.zip`.
2.  Use `mv` to move all files from subfolders into a single empty folder.
3.  Rename all files by replacing each digit with the next (e.g., `a19b.txt` becomes `a20b.txt`).
Finally, it asks: "What does running `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in bash on that folder show?"

For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "

Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as

2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt

eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt

That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0.

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)
 let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

Hi anant,

Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.

In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

Hi Hisham,

Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

Hi manmeet,

I don’t know about solution to this.

Some network setting might be causing problem.

Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.

When I logged in today it says score is 0.

Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?

Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?

If [seek] (
[Nptel Seekh](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/courses/ns_25t1_se2002)
) can access [TDS exam] (
[Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1)
) then why we need to submit from seek?

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to

The actual GA questions are on

on the

Hi
[@Nelson](/u/nelson)

Your answers on the
[exam](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/)
 site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).

It gives the error:

> **Image Description**: The image displays a multi-part screen capturing a data science problem involving date calculations.

The top section presents a question: "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-09 to 2012-06-19?". An entered answer of "1349" is marked "Incorrect. Try again." Instructions clarify the date format (year-month-day) and require including both start and end dates.

The middle section shows a Python script utilizing the `datetime` module. The script defines `start_date` as `date(1986, 8, 9)` and `end_date` as `date(2012, 6, 19)`. It first finds the first Wednesday on or after the `start_date` by iterating day by day until `current_date.weekday()` is 2 (Wednesday). Then, it counts Wednesdays by incrementing `wednesday_count` and `current_date` by `timedelta(days=7)` in a `while` loop until `current_date` exceeds `end_date`. The final line prints the `wednesday_count`.

The bottom-middle section displays a terminal output showing the execution of the Python script (`python.exe d:/testing/t.py`), which outputs "Number of Wednesdays: 1349".

The very bottom section shows a chat interface repeating the question "How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1986-08-09 to 2012-06-19?" and providing an answer: "There are 1349 Wednesdays in the date range from August 9, 1986, to June 19, 2012." This contradicts the "Incorrect" feedback from the initial problem statement.

*   Combine content from the three files into a single string.
*   Iterate through lines, split them into 'symbol' and 'value', and strip whitespace.
*   Conditionally sum numerical values if their associated 'symbol' is '4', '7', or '9'.
*   Include error handling for `IndexError` and `ValueError` during parsing.
The console output at the bottom of the left pane shows prompts for file paths (`/content/data1.csv`, `/content/data2.csv`, `/content/data3.txt`) and the final calculated sum: `The sum of all values associated with the specified symbols is: 31512.0`.

The right pane displays a web page, likely from an online course or tutorial. It features:
*   A YouTube video thumbnail titled "COMPUTER STUFF THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU" with a subtitle "Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM, Part 2".
*   A problem description outlining a data processing task involving three files:
    *   `data1.csv`: encoded in CP 1252.
    *   `data2.csv`: encoded in UTF-8.
    *   `data3.txt`: tab-separated, encoded in UTF-16.
*   Each file is described as having two columns: 'symbol' and 'value'.
*   A question prompt: "What is the sum of all values associated with these symbols?".

Hi Shouvik,

Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.

Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

kind regards

Try copy pasting exact symbols
— OR † OR €
 Can you share code in code block, it’s difficult to read symbols that are present.

Also have a look at what
all_content
 variable contains, see if there are some problem with content.

 this is almost certainly due to a (typically corporate) firewall or antivirus. Please try with a personal laptop from a public / home network.

        <div class="bar baz" data-value="17">
          <div class="baz foo" data-value="29"></div>

Hello Gentlemen Instructors,

In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,

In one of the classes, you said that there is something  - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??

Thanks and regards,

> **Image Description**: The image displays a PowerShell terminal session demonstrating file hashing and file modification operations.

1.  The first command, `Get-FileHash -Path formatted.md -Algorithm SHA256`, calculates the SHA256 hash of the file `C:\Users\kaiff\formatted.md`, which is `216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175`.
2.  Next, `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 "F:\BS DATA SCIENCE\Diploma Level\TERM 2\TDS\README.md" > formatted.md` is executed. This command uses Prettier to format a `README.md` file from a specified path and redirects its output to overwrite `formatted.md`.
3.  A second execution of `Get-FileHash -Path formatted.md -Algorithm SHA256` shows the SHA256 hash of `formatted.md` remains `216375D6F5A1DAF9EB6350251E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED6E57D9568E8B1AD175`, indicating the file's content did not change after the Prettier operation.
4.  Finally, `certutil -hashfile formatted.md SHA256` is used as an alternative method to calculate the SHA256 hash of `formatted.md`, confirming the same hash value `216375d6f5a1daf9eb6350251e9f0a7395a0b2988d58ed6e57d9568e8b1ad175` and displaying a successful completion message.

how to calculate How many Wednesdays are there in the date range 1981-08-30 to 2017-07-17?

The dates are in the year-month-day format. Include both the start and end date in your count. You can do this using any tool (e.g. Excel, Python, JavaScript, manually).

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.

[@23f2003845](/u/23f2003845)

If you are on Windows Powershell

Then instead of
sha256sum
 you can simply use
Get-FileHash

Send the output of the
npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md
 to a text file eg.
output.txt
 and then use
Get-FileHash
 on powershell with the
output.txt
 and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.

You might be able to pipe the data directly to
Get-FileHash
 but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

Kind regards

 Sir

as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.

I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.

Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?

If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?

 You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable with, including pandas.

But since you
already
 know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like
awk
 (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.

Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt

A Hash is a
nearly
 unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)

Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question

quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly.

Try again." message is visible below the input field. An information icon is present on the right side of the input box.

It can be GOLD,gold, or even GoLD.

"  Get all rows where the Type is “Gold”. Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as “Gold”. Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up.  "

Try to go through the given video of css selector and go through all foo classes carefully(using inspect) and sum them up!

> **Image Description**: The image displays a command-line interface (CLI) and a web-based question interface.

The CLI section shows:
*   A directory listing (likely from a `dir` command) of files named `F1.txt` through `F120.txt`, each with a date (e.g., `06-02-2023`) and time (e.g., `08:52`). The total size of these 120 files is 507162 bytes.
*   A PowerShell command: `(Get-ChildItem -path .\list files attributes | Where-Object {$_.Length -ge 1235 and $_.LastWriteTime -ge "11/06/2019 10:48:00"}) | Measure-Object -Property Length -sum`.
*   The output of this PowerShell command, which summarizes attributes of the filtered files:
    *   `Sum: 507162`
    *   `Count: 96`
    *   `Average: 5282.9375`
    *   `Minimum: 1235`
    *   `Maximum: 8788`
    *   `Property: Length`
*   Another, incomplete PowerShell command similar to the first one.

The web-based question section, titled "List files and attributes (0.75 marks)", includes:
*   Instructions to download and extract `_list_files_attributes.zip` and use `ls` (or `dir` as seen in CLI) to list files with date and size.
*   A question: "what's the total size of all files at least 1235 bytes large and modified on or after Wed, 6 Nov, 2019, 10:48 am IST?"
*   An input field containing `507162`.
*   An error message "Incorrect. Try again" displayed below the input.
*   A hint advising against using Windows Explorer or copying from inside a ZIP file for extraction, and suggesting `unzip`, `7-Zip`, or similar utilities to preserve timestamps.

Hi Arnav,

I tried your script on your dataset.

Problem might be you are not executing
grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum
 in correct directory, you would need to execute it from
all_files
 directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

Time of modification of each of these files is 14 Jan 2025 which might be the day you unzipped them. Depending upon what software you use it might change modification date while unzipping. use unzip command line tool or winrar extractor, these are 2 tools we have tested.

Hi Saravanan,

I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name
Bob
, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.

We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.

kind regards

A table named `tickets` is described, containing columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Sample rows are visible, showing `type` values such as 'Silver', 'gold', and 'BRONZE', along with corresponding numeric `units` and `price` values.

The problem question asks to calculate the "total sales of all the items in the 'Gold' ticket type." Specific instructions accompanying the question state to "Get all rows where the Type is 'Gold'. Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as 'Gold'. Calculate the sales as Units * Price, and sum them up."

An attempted SQL query is shown: `SELECT sum(units*price) FROM tickets WHERE type='gold' COLLATE nocase;`. Below this query, an error message "Error: Got [[124944.59]]..." is displayed. The `COLLATE nocase` part of the query is underlined in red, indicating a syntax or execution issue in that specific section. The problem instructions are repeated directly beneath the error message.

[this link](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1)
 and have attempted it. Hope the scores saved would be considered

> **Image Description**: The image displays a multi-part question from a "Tools in Data Science" course, specifically on "Multi-cursor edits to convert to JSON" worth 0.5 marks.

The instructions guide the user to:
1.  Download a file named `q-multi-cursor-json.txt`.
2.  Use multi-cursors to convert its content into a single JSON object where key-value pairs are structured as `{key: value, key: value, ...}`.
3.  Paste the resulting JSON into the hashing tool at `tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash` and click the "Hash" button.

An input field is visible, pre-filled with the hexadecimal string `c0b9426a7f358720f193d3806497ec0d81d10d835085d0f284f804bf3a6a1536`. Below this field, an error message states: "Incorrect. Try again."

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.

Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

Okay, i will go through my json object once.

And for hash code i am using chrome only

> **Image Description**: The image displays a dark-themed webpage with a red banner at the top indicating a deadline: "Ended at Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST". The main title is "TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development To" (partially visible). Below this is a section titled "Instructions", detailing seven guidelines for an assignment or quiz:
1.  Learn what is needed, with provided reading material, but allows skipping if answers are known.
2.  Check answers regularly using a visible "Check" button; multiple checks are allowed, showing correct/incorrect answers.
3.  Save regularly using a visible "Save" button; multiple saves are allowed, with the last submission evaluated.
4.  Reloading is permitted as answers are saved in the browser, and questions remain unchanged except for randomized parameters.
5.  Browser issues may occur, suggesting turning off security restrictions or trying another browser.
6.  Any resources, including the Internet, ChatGPT, friends, libraries, or frameworks, are allowed.
7.  The quiz is "hackable," permitting users to obtain answers by hacking the code.

Following the instructions, a section titled "Should you take TDS this term?" includes two bullet points:
*   Completion under 2 hours indicates likely success in TDS.
*   A score above 8/10 may result in an S or A grade with effort and luck.

Hello Sir,

I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.

I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of
80 out of 100
. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “
absent
” for this particular assignment.

I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?
