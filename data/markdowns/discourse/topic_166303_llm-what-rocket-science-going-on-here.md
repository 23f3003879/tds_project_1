The lectures primarily focus on surface-level explanations without ensuring a strong foundational understanding of the topics. Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.

Hi Hari,

The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.

Have you watched this session in particular?

> **Image Description**: The image displays a title slide with the text "Week 3 Session 1" in large, white, sans-serif font. This text is centered on a translucent, dark blue rectangular overlay with slightly rounded corners.

Behind and around the overlay, a background pattern composed of various flat-design icons related to data and technology is visible. These icons include:
*   Bar charts and pie charts, representing data visualizations.
*   Network diagrams or circuit board-like patterns with connected dots, suggesting algorithms or data flow.
*   A stylized globe symbol, indicating global data or networks.
*   A laptop or monitor icon, representing computing tools.
*   Lines of text, resembling code or data entries.
*   Tools such as pencils and a wrench-like object.
*   Abstract geometric patterns, potentially symbolizing data structures or visual analytics.

The background itself features an orange-brown border and a lighter beige interior where these icons are placed.

If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it

> **Image Description**: The image displays a computer screen featuring a web browser (Opera) on the left and a video conferencing interface on the right. The web browser's active tab is "Speed Dial", showing several shortcut tiles. Titles of these tiles relevant to a "Tools in Data Science" course include "TDS Discourse", "(159) Tools in Data Science", and "tds june 2024". Additional visible tiles are "App Dev II Project Doc...", "Java Tutorial | Learn Jav...", "Prime Number Progra...", "PDSA", and "MAD-2 resources". Browser tabs for "Meet - odh-ycbm-ahj" and "Large language models..." are also open. No specific code, question statements, commands, graphs, or tables are visible within the browser's content area. The Windows taskbar is visible at the bottom, showing the date as 11-07-2024 and time as 20:14. The right side of the screen shows a video conference participant panel with the name "Amit Kumar Gupta".

followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases

> **Image Description**: The image displays a web browser window open to an online course page titled "Data sourcing" within a "May 2024 - TDS" (Tools in Data Science) curriculum. The left navigation pane highlights "2. Data sourcing" as the current lesson. The main content area outlines data sourcing concepts, including controlling extraction areas to extract tables and saving extracted data into CSV format. Links and references for "PDF Scraping - Notebook," the "tabula package," and the "pandas package" are visible. An "Optional: Real-life scraping" section describes a scenario involving scraping data from emarketer.com. Below this text, an embedded video or image shows a webpage and a smaller video call window. A Google Meet window on the right side of the screen shows a participant named "Carlton D'Silva." The browser's top bar indicates multiple open tabs related to "TDS LLM," "TDS Topics," and "ChatGPT."

But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.

Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Kind regards
