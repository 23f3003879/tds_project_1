Same issue with me sir.

This is how my dashboard looks like. It shows the same for week 2 as well.

[![dashboard_tds_jahnaviHunsigida](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/7/8/782e69e2b13a88c1e2dd54a2cb28d8778828c041_2_690x413.jpeg)

> **Image Description**: The image displays the "Grades" section of an IIT Madras online course, identified as "Jan 2025- TDS".

The left navigation panel shows "Modules" and "Grades", with "Grades" currently selected. Below this, a course structure is visible, including "Course Introduction", "Module 1: Development Tools" (expanded), and "Module 2: Deployment Tools". "Graded Assignment 1" is highlighted as an "Assignment" under "Module 1".

The main content area on the right is titled "Graded Assignment 1". It specifies a due date of "2025-01-26, 23:59 IST". The submission policy indicates that "You may submit any number of times before the due date. The final submission will be considered."

A section addressing difficulty accessing the assignment lists six points:
1.  Ad blockers need to be disabled/removed.
2.  The site requires cookies for authentication; cookie/tracker blocking should be avoided.
3.  Javascript is required for the site to work correctly.
4.  Chrome Browser is the recommended software.
5.  Browser extensions that may interfere with the site should be disabled.
6.  Overly aggressive anti-virus software may cause similar access problems.

It explicitly states: "You MUST use your Student Id (eg. 22f3xxxxxx@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) to do the Graded Assignment evaluation."

The visible portion of the assignment includes a question: "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." This question is accompanied by "Yes" and "No" radio button options.

Likewise the GAs also are available through the links in the seek portal as well as on the course domain shared above.

The course introduction has very important information. Many students who faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read the intro. Please be diligent to read
everything carefully.

Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…

> **Image Description**: The image displays information about a course, featuring several sections of text. At the top, there is a collapsed section titled "This course exposes you to real-life tools," followed by an expanded, highlighted section titled "This course is quite hard." Below, under "Here's students' feedback:", a bulleted list provides comments: "It *used* to be an easy course until 2024.", "Now it's hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.", "Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.", "LLMs grade you – unpredictably.", and "The ROE is hard." Hash symbols are present at the end of each feedback bullet. A subsequent paragraph states, "You need a *good* understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts." Following this, text advises, "Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you're ready for this course. Please drop this course in a later term if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now." At the bottom, two more collapsed sections are visible: "Programming skills are a pre-requisite" and "We encourage learning by sharing."

I’m confused where exactly is the TDS course?

[![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/c/2/c27c6f5e0febea8fee5c5ae9668eadf3bcdb8149_2_690x385.png)

> **Image Description**: The image displays an online course interface for "ET Moduls | Jan 2023 - TDS", specifically showing "Graded Assignment 1" under "Module 1: Development Tools".

The main panel details the assignment:
*   **Due date:** 2023-01-26, 23:59 IST.
*   **Submission policy:** Multiple submissions allowed, with the final one considered for grading.
*   **Access troubleshooting guidelines:** Six points are listed, including disabling ad blockers, checking cookie settings, enabling JavaScript, recommending Chrome, disabling interfering browser extensions, and managing anti-virus software.
*   **Student ID requirement:** Students must use their IITM study ID for the assignment, or scores will not be evaluated.
*   **Question 1 (1 point):** "I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." This is a multiple-choice question with "Yes" and "No" as options. The phrase "this link" is an active hyperlink.
*   A "Submit Answers" button is present at the bottom of the visible content.

Where are the weekly videos?

Where and what is the assignment?

I’m confused.
